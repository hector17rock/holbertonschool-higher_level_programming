# RESTful API Project

## 📌 Introduction

In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential. This project delves into the domain of RESTful APIs, a cornerstone in the realm of web services. The Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, stateless, and cacheable communication system.

This approach enables easy integration of web services, making them accessible to a wide range of applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **HTTP/HTTPS Basics:** Understand foundational principles of data transfer protocols, request methods, and secure communication.
- **API Consumption with Command Line:** Interact with APIs using `curl` and analyze the structure and responses.
- **API Consumption with Python:** Use the `requests` library to fetch and process API data.
- **API Development with `http.server`:** Learn the fundamentals of creating an API using built-in Python modules.
- **API Development with Flask:** Explore advanced API development with Flask’s routing and data handling capabilities.
- **API Security & Authentication:** Secure APIs using Basic Auth and JWT.
- **OpenAPI & Documentation Standards:** Learn the importance of API documentation and maintainability.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

RESTful APIs are pivotal in system integration, acting as bridges for cross-platform and inter-application communication. Whether for social media, automation, or IoT, REST APIs power interactions. Learning how to consume, build, secure, and document them is a critical skill for modern software engineers.

**Components:**

- **Client:** Initiates requests (e.g., browsers or apps).
- **Web Server:** Receives requests, routes them.
- **API Server:** Business logic layer, handles processing.
- **Database:** Stores and returns persistent data.

**Flow:**

1. Client sends request to Web Server.
2. Web Server forwards it to API Server.
3. API Server processes and interacts with the Database.
4. API Server sends response to Web Server.
5. Web Server returns it to the Client.

## ✅ Tasks Overview

### 0. Basics of HTTP/HTTPS

- Differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS.
- Explore structure of HTTP requests and responses.
- Identify and describe common HTTP methods and status codes.

📁 File: N/A  
📚 Resources:
- [MDN - Overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
- Wireshark (optional)

---

### 1. Consume API using Command Line (`curl`)

- Install and use `curl`.
- Fetch content and JSON from public APIs (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).
- Use flags like `-X`, `-I`, `-d` to customize requests.

📁 File: `task_01_curl.sh`  
📚 Resources:
- [Everything curl](https://everything.curl.dev/)
- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

---

### 2. API Consumption with Python

- Use `requests` library.
- Fetch and print API response.
- Save structured data to CSV.

📁 File: `task_02_requests.py`  
📚 Resources:
- [Python requests documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
- [`csv` module docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

---

### 3. Simple API with `http.server`

- Set up server with `http.server`.
- Implement endpoints (`/`, `/data`, `/status`).
- Handle undefined routes with 404.

📁 File: `task_03_http_server.py`  
📚 Resources:
- [http.server docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)

---

### 4. Simple API with Flask

- Create Flask app and define routes.
- Handle GET and POST methods.
- Serve JSON, handle user data dynamically.

📁 File: `task_04_flask.py`  
📚 Resources:
- [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

---

### 5. API Security & Authentication

- Implement Basic Auth with `Flask-HTTPAuth`.
- Set up JWT auth using `Flask-JWT-Extended`.
- Role-based access control.
- Proper error handling (401/403 responses).

📁 File: `task_05_basic_security.py`  
📚 Resources:
- [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/)
- [Flask-JWT-Extended](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/)

## 💡 Final Notes

- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.
- Test endpoints using `curl`, Postman, or Python scripts.
- Remember to remove testing data before pushing for review.
- Follow security best practices—never expose secrets or hardcoded credentials.
