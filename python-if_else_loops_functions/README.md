# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project covers the basics of control flow in Python using `if`, `else`, `elif`, loops (`for` and `while`), function definition, variable scoping, and basic arithmetic operations. It is part of the **Higher Level Programming** track at Holberton School.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without using Google:

### General:
- Why indentation is important in Python
- How to use `if`, `if ... else`, and `if ... elif ... else`
- The role of comments
- How to assign values to variables
- How to use `while` and `for` loops
- The use of `break` and `continue`
- The `else` clause in loops
- What `pass` means and when to use it
- The purpose of `range()`
- What a function is and how to define/use one
- The behavior of functions without a `return` statement
- Scope of variables in Python
- What a traceback is and how to interpret it
- The basic arithmetic operators and how to use them

---

## ✅ Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Files interpreted/compiled with Python 3.8.x on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts must end with a new line
- The first line must be: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All code must conform to **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable (`chmod +x filename`)
- File length will be tested with `wc`

> **Note:** Lists are not required knowledge for this project.

## 📝 Tasks

### `0-positive_or_negative.py`
Assigns a random number to a variable and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

### `1-last_digit.py`
Prints the last digit of a random number and interprets it (greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0).

### `2-print_alphabet.py`
Prints the alphabet in lowercase, no newline.

### `3-print_alphabt.py`
Prints the alphabet in lowercase excluding `e` and `q`.

### `4-print_hexa.py`
Prints numbers 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format.

### `5-print_comb2.py`
Prints numbers from 00 to 99 separated by a comma and space.

### `6-print_comb3.py`
Prints all combinations of two digits (no repeats like `10` if `01` already printed).

### `7-islower.py`
Function to check if a character is lowercase.

### `8-uppercase.py`
Function to print a string in uppercase using ASCII manipulation.

### `9-print_last_digit.py`
Function that prints and returns the last digit of a number.

### `10-add.py`
Function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### `11-pow.py`
Function that computes the power of two numbers (`a ^ b`).

### `12-fizzbuzz.py`
Function that prints numbers 1–100 with `Fizz`, `Buzz`, and `FizzBuzz` rules.

## 💡 Tips

- Use `ord()` to convert characters to ASCII values.
- Avoid using Python built-in functions like `str.upper()` where restricted.
- Practice consistent indentation: 4 spaces per level.
- Use `range()` to simplify iteration.
