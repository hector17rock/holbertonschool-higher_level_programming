# Python - Hello, World

## üêç Author‚Äôs Disclaimer

> ‚ÄúWelcome to the Python world!  
> You'll soon find that with Python (and most higher-level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while others allow multiple valid approaches.  
> Python has a linter/style guide called **PEP8**, also known as **pycodestyle**. At Holberton, we won‚Äôt start off with strict PyCode enforcement‚Äîit‚Äôs more rigorous than standard PEP8. Don‚Äôt worry if you see a warning using PEP8, you can ignore it (for now).  
> Enjoy!
