## 🔍 Introduction
In this project, we dive into Python's approach to handling objects, understanding the distinction between mutable and immutable types, and learning how these affect performance and functionality. 🎯

## 📁 Files and Descriptions

- `0-answer.txt` to `28-answer.txt`: These files contain responses to various exercises that help in understanding Python's object handling. 📝
  
- `19-copy_list.py`: A Python script containing a function `copy_list(a_list)` that returns a copy of the input list. It utilizes slicing to create a shallow copy. 📄

- `19-main.py`: A test script to demonstrate the functionality of the `copy_list` function, ensuring that the list is copied correctly. 🧪

## 💡 Concepts Explained

### 🔄 Mutable vs Immutable
- **🔧 Mutable Objects**: Objects that can be changed after creation, such as lists, dicts, and sets.
- **🔒 Immutable Objects**: Objects that cannot be changed after creation, such as strings, tuples, and numbers.

### ⚡ Why It Matters
Understanding the distinction is vital for memory optimization and avoiding unintended side effects in your programs. 💾

### 📤 Function Arguments
Objects are passed by reference in Python. For mutable objects, changes within a function affect the original object, while for immutable objects, changes do not affect the original. 🔗
