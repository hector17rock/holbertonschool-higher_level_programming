# Python - Inheritance

## Overview

This project focuses on the concept of **inheritance** in Python, a fundamental feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). You'll learn how to create subclasses, override methods, use built-in introspection functions, and define class hierarchies. You will also explore geometric classes through inheritance and validation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

- What is a superclass, base class, or parent class
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What the default superclass in Python is
- How to override an inherited method or attribute
- What attributes and methods are inherited by subclasses
- The purpose of inheritance in OOP
- When and how to use:
  - `isinstance()`
  - `issubclass()`
  - `type()`
  - `super()`

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Python 3.8.5 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- All files must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Files must be executable and end with a new line
- Follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- Each module, class, and function must contain docstrings
- Docstrings must be full sentences describing the purpose
- Use only `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` for editing

### Python Test Cases

- All test files go in the `tests/` folder
- All test files must end in `.txt`
- Use this command to run tests:
  ```bash
  python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
