# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Authorâ€™s Note
Welcome to another step in your Python journey! In this project, you'll learn to manipulate two essential data structures: lists and tuples. By the end, you should be able to use them confidently in a wide range of contexts.

## Resources

**Read or watch:**
- [3.1.3. Lists â€“ Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
- [Data Structures (until section 5.3)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- [Learn to Program 6: Lists (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General Concepts
- What are lists and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Most common list methods and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What list comprehensions are and how to use them
- What tuples are and how to use them
- When to use tuples vs lists
- What a sequence is
- Tuple packing and sequence unpacking
- What the `del` statement is and how to use it

## Requirements

- **Python Version:** Python 3.8.5
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Style:** Use `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- **Shebang:** First line of all files must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Executability:** All scripts must be executable
- **End with newline:** All files must end with a new line
- **No imports unless explicitly allowed**

## Project Structure

This project is part of the `holbertonschool-higher_level_programming` GitHub repository, inside the directory: `python-data_structures`.

## Tasks

### 0. Print a list of integers
`0-print_list_integer.py`  
Prints all integers in a list using `str.format()`.

### 1. Secure access to an element in a list
`1-element_at.py`  
Retrieves an element at a given index, handling out-of-bound cases.

### 2. Replace element
`2-replace_in_list.py`  
Replaces an element in a list at a given index.

### 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
`3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`  
Prints a list of integers in reverse using `str.format()`.

### 4. Replace in a copy
`4-new_in_list.py`  
Returns a new list with one element replaced, preserving the original list.

### 5. Can you C me now?
`5-no_c.py`  
Removes all `c` and `C` characters from a string (without `replace()`).

### 6. Lists of lists = Matrix
`6-print_matrix_integer.py`  
Prints a matrix of integers using `str.format()`.

### 7. Tuples addition
`7-add_tuple.py`  
Adds two tuples and returns a new tuple with two integers.

### 8. More returns!
`8-multiple_returns.py`  
Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

### 9. Find the max
`9-max_integer.py`  
Finds the biggest integer in a list without using `max()`.

### 10. Only by 2
`10-divisible_by_2.py`  
Returns a list of booleans indicating if each element is divisible by 2.

### 11. Delete at
`11-delete_at.py`  
Deletes an element from a list at a specific index (no `pop()` allowed).

### 12. Switch
`12-switch.py`  
Swaps the values of two variables using tuple unpacking in exactly 5 lines.
